 * @ingroup NET_LWIP
 * This is the LPC18xx/43xx EMAC driver for LWIP. This driver supports both
 * RTOS-based and no-RTOS operation with LWIP. WHen using an RTOS, several
 * threads will be created for handling RX and TX packet fucntions.
 *
 * Note that some LWIP examples may not necessarily use all the provided
 * LWIP driver functions or may contain overriden versions of the functions.
 * (For example, PHY drives may have their own implementation of the MII
 * read/write functions).
