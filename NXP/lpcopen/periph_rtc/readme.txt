RTC example

Example description
This example shows how to use the RTC, generate periodic interrupts,
and use the alarm interrupt.

The RTC is configured to generate an interrupt on each second field
register change. An interrupt is also configured when certain alarm field
values match the time field values. The LEDs will toggle states based on
the RTC events. You can also use a terminal program with the UART to
monitor RTC time and events.
